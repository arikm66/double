# Client — minimal

Slim React + Vite client for local development.

Run locally:

1. cd client
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

- Dev server: http://localhost:3000
- Requests to `/api/*` are proxied to `http://localhost:5000` (your server)

UI allows sending arbitrary GET/POST requests so you can test your backend quickly.
